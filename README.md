## About ##
This is a very simple CLI tool made with rust to help you write quick notes to yourself. This is useful when an idea suddenly pops into your head, and you want to quickly *jot* it down somewhere for later.

At the moment this is only a simple CLI, but in the future, I hope to implement a GUI and an installer as well.
